## DESCRIPTION

Scenic ToDo requires asynchronous CRUD methods to several APIs, including weather, authorization, images, quotations, and user-created data. It appears as an app dominated by an image with an overlay for a quotation, the current weather, a clock, and the user's to-do list. Each overlay is filtered to allow a view for the content underneath and each requires interaction to show all their data or functionality.
